<h4>Creating a testimonial slider using HTML and CSS is a great way to showcase customer feedback and highlight the success of your product or service. The slider can be customized to fit your website's design and can be used to cycle through multiple testimonials quickly and easily. The HTML code will define the structure of the slider while the CSS code can be used to add styling and effects to make the slider more visually appealing. With a few lines of code, you can create a great-looking, highly functional testimonial slider that will give your visitors a better understanding of your product.</h4>

Created this by following a tutorial in <h2>freeCodeCamp</h2>

I customized the text to output compliments about myself XD
